## Technical Background
I've been programming for most of my life now. I began with Scratch in 2015 for a school activity. I did some HTML and CSS a couple years later in 2018 for a coding class but we focused less on programming and more on the logistics behind it. Later that year I began robotics and was apart of the programming team for 3 years using more GUI's than typing. Finally, I took CS50 in my free time during my senior year in 2022 where I got a more well-rounded understanding of programming using low-level languages; I took this knowledge with me to college for my Computer Science degree at GVSU.
